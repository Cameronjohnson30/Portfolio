  <h3>My background</h3>
    <p>I graduated at Oregon City High school in 2009 I attended 2 weeks of classes at ccc until I badly sprained my ankle causing me to withdraw from the welding and horticulture class I was in. I have had a decent amount of jobs I started painting houses in my sophomore year of high school did that for two years. My boss would pick me and about three of my friends up after school and we would paint till dark. After I graduated I worked for my father doing construction making pretty good money I thought for a seventeen year old, then the economy collapsed so I was laid off the Friday before my 19th birthday.
