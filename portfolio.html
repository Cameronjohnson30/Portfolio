  <h3>My background</h3>
    <p>I graduated at Oregon City High school in 2009 I attended 2 weeks of classes at ccc until I badly sprained my ankle causing me to withdraw from the welding and horticulture class I was in. I have had a decent amount of jobs I started painting houses in my sophomore year of high school did that for two years. My boss would pick me and about three of my friends up after school and we would paint till dark. After I graduated I worked for my father doing construction making pretty good money I thought for a seventeen year old, then the economy collapsed so I was laid off the Friday before my 19th birthday. 
    </p>

    <p>Not knowing what I wanted to do in life I needed a job and I needed money for a season pass to snowboard I applied and got a job as a lift operator at Mt Hood meadows. I really loved it up there it was like having a huge family and everyone was excited to be doing what we loved. I became the youngest operator in charge of Mt Hood Express the busiest lift at night that was an amazing accomplishment.</p>

    <p>My cousin broke his leg in the summer time and with the Mt closed I wasn`t working so he asked me to help him out around his diesel mechanic shop. I enjoyed learning how to work on a variety of different vehicles, boats, motorcycles, ect. Once his leg was healed it was just about time the mt opened up again and I went back to being a lift operator that season though just after Christmas I fell and dislocated my shoulder, I put got it back in myself but after that it just got worse I ended up dislocating my shoulder around 15 times and eventually had to quit work and have surgery. I eventually was healed and once again had no job, my cousin knew this and asked me back so I was wrenching again. I did that for another year and got pretty burnt out on it and knew that is not what I wanted to do with the rest of my life so we parted ways.</p>

    <p>Once again jobless my friend offered me a job doing heating and air conditioning it paid well so I took the offer. After 3 years of being in attics and crawl spaces either freezing in the winter or sweating the summer and driving around the Portland metro area our hours were being cut so and I just had enough of it so I left them and moved down to southern Oregon with another friend. He got me into this hippie commune and we grew pot, it was a nice change of pace from the busy Portland life. After about a year the owner of the property became very hard to work for and money was tight so I started working at other farms to make more, while doing that I became friends with another farm property owner and me and my friend moved there. I worked there up until september of 2021 unfortunately the market was flooded thanks to the cartel grows that popped up everywhere, with prices way down and the government cracking down on farms It was time to move on.</p> 

    <p>I chose coding because I needed something that wasn`t so hard on my body I have had lots of injuries, with this skill I can land a comfortable job out of the elements and it has a very high job security with the world only going further into tech. I started teaching myself on free websites and knew it was a good fit for me I enjoy learning it, I like over coming the problems that I come across thankfully my time as a mechanic has taught me to be patient when dealing with something problematic.</p>
